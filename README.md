# Analysing possible generation adequacy issues with Germany's Coal Phaseout

With the announcement of coal phase out in Germany the issue of generation adequacy has become critically important. Here the data and code used for the analysis is provided.

The analysis is based on following indicators:

## Availability Factors used for calculation of reliable capacity

| Power Plant | Availability|
| -- | -- |
| Pump Storage | 1,000|
| Biomass	|0,830|
| Run of River|	0,740|
| Other	|0,900|
| Oil |	0,845|
| Gas	|0,902|
| Coal |	0,857|
| Lignite |	0,857|

## Best and worst case assumptions w.r.t VRE (Variable Renewable Energy) Installed capacities (2023)

|Installed Capacity [GW]| Worst Case | Best Case|
|---|---|---|
|Wind Onshore|54.7|67.7|
|Wind Offshore|7.1|9.4|
|PV|50.3|50.3|
|Total|112.2|124.5|
